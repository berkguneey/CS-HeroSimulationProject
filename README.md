***Hero Simulation Project***

In the 23rd century the war between two empires led to a nuclear apocalypse which led to extinction of nearly all civilization and animal life. 
As we are the only survivors we are trying to build a new civilization but resources required to sustain life are rare. The radioactivity makes outdoors dangerous. 
We are living in an old bunker that is left from WW2. Volunteers need to get out to the dangerous lands and get to the places where they can get resources. Luckily the 
bunker we are living has an old radar that can find creatures on our path to the resources. As a surviving engineer you are required to write a simulation that can simulate 
if a volunteer can reach to resources. Be aware that our radar indicates that there are dangerous creatures and even zombies on the wasteland.

Write a simulation that find outs if the hero would survive or not. You can use the following sample input and output as a reference. If the volunteer hero faces an enemy he 
needs to fight against it until one of them dies. To simulate fights you can accept that enemy and the hero attack at the same time. hp represents health points. Each attack 
decreases health points equal to attack. To avoid radioactivity volunteer hero wears a special heavy armor that makes him walk meter by meter.

**Sample Input:**

Resources are 5000 meters away  
Hero has 1000 hp  
Hero attack is 10  
Bug is Enemy  
Lion is Enemy  
Zombie is Enemy  
Bug has 50 hp  
Bug attack is 2  
Lion has 100 hp  
Lion attack is 15  
Zombie has 300 hp  
Zombie attack is 7  
There is a Zombie at position 1681  
There is a Bug at position 276  
There is a Bug at position 489  
There is a Lion at position 1527  
There is a Lion at position 2865  
There is a Zombie at position 3523  

**Sample Output:**

Hero started journey with 1000 HP!  
Hero defeated Bug with 990 HP remaining  
Hero defeated Bug with 980 HP remaining  
Hero defeated Lion with 830 HP remaining  
Hero defeated Zombie with 620 HP remaining  
Hero defeated Lion with 470 HP remaining  
Hero defeated Zombie with 260 HP remaining  
Hero Survived!
